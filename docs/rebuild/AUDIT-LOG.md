# V2 Rebuild Audit Log

This file records completed rebuild phases without secrets, credential content,
tokens, signed URLs, or sensitive device identifiers.

Each entry contains:

- local time with UTC offset;
- objective;
- contract or invariant;
- changed files;
- tests and gates executed;
- result;
- completed phase commit hash;
- remaining risk;
- next step.

Entries are append-only. Corrections are added as new notes rather than rewriting
historical evidence.
